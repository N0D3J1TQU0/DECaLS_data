# DECaLS_data
- get_brick.py: access to nersc database to download decals data. Need to change initvalues at start of script
- photo_z_finder.py: initvalues set to 15 SPT clusters. Need to change path in several lines through the script
- overlap_test.py: compilation of useful pipelines to test data
